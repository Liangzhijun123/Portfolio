            As a web and mobile computing major, I thrive on bringing ideas to
            life through design and collaboration. There's something incredibly
            fulfilling about working alongside a partner to create innovative
            projects that captivate audiences. Whether it's brainstorming ideas
            or diving deep into coding, the collaborative process has pushed me
            beyond the limits.{" "}

            One of my greatest joys is designing websites that not only look
            stunning but also deliver seamless user experiences. I love
            experimenting with different effects and techniques to enhance the
            visual appeal and functionality of a site.
